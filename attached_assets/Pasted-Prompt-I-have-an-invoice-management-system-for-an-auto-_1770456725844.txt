Prompt:
"I have an invoice management system for an auto service business. When invoices are created, they consume PPF (Paint Protection Film) roll inventory. I need to implement a feature where deleting an invoice replenishes the roll quantities back to inventory.
Current Issue:

When I delete an invoice, the roll quantities are NOT being restored
Console logs and server logs I added are NOT appearing at all when deletion happens
This suggests the deletion code path might not be executing properly

System Details:

Invoice contains service items including PPF items
PPF items have a 'Quantity' field that specifies how many sqft were consumed from rolls
In the Masters section, there's a 'Garware Elite' PPF product with roll inventory (Roll1: 70 sqft, Roll2: 1190 sqft, Roll3: 3000 sqft, Roll4: 4000 sqft)
When an invoice is created, it deducts the quantity from the appropriate rolls
Example: Invoice AG-2026-0001 has a PPF item consuming from Roll2 (400sqft from Roll2, then 120sqft from Roll1)

What I need:

Fix the invoice deletion handler so it actually executes (logs aren't appearing)
Implement logic to restore roll quantities when invoice is deleted
The restoration should add back the exact quantities that were consumed from each roll

Can you help me debug why the deletion code isn't running and implement the roll quantity restoration feature?"

This prompt gives clear context about your problem and what you need fixed!only the invoice2:49 PMHere's a simplified prompt focused only on the invoice deletion issue:

Prompt:
"I have an invoice deletion feature that's not working. When I click delete on an invoice, nothing happens - even the console.log and server logs I added are not appearing at all.
Current Issue:

Delete button exists on the invoice
When clicked, no logs appear (neither client-side console.log nor server-side logs)
This means the delete handler is not executing at all

What I need:
Fix the invoice deletion so that:

The delete handler actually executes when the delete button is clicked
Console/server logs appear to confirm the code is running
The invoice gets deleted from the database

The main problem is that the deletion code path itself is not being triggered. Can you help debug why the delete functionality isn't executing?"
